-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	Using GnuPG::Handles which are meant to be dupes
	is now more viable and documented.  In particular,
	file descriptor numbers (properly prefixed, according
	to the open() documentation) can be used.
	This helps when using symbols and and object handles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	AutoLoader is now used; this may descrease
	compile-time.

    *	Changes so that testing on recent development versions
	of GnuPG (namely 1.0.1e) works, or notably says
	that the error is occuring because of GnuPG version
	differences.


Noteworthy changes in 0.07
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY issue:
	GnuPG::Options->meta_signing_key() now expects
	an argument of type GnuPG::Object, instead of a scalar
	key id.  See the following note for more details.

    *	GnuPG::Options 'meta' methods that deal with keys arguments
	are more consistent now.  Meta methods that accept key
	ids are now appended with _id(s); other meta methods
	that accept keys receive GnuPG::Key objects.


Noteworthy changes in 0.06
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    *	textmode option added to GnuPG::Options, and
	booleans of GnuPG::Options now make use
